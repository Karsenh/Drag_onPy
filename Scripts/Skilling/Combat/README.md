## Cow Killer:

### Start:
in the cow pen bordering Lumbridge & Al Kharid.

### Setup:
* Equip the best defensive armor you can to avoid dying (start with iron)
* Equip the best offensive weapon you can to do the most damage (start with iron scim)
* Close the gate to the pen (try to find a world where no cows are outside of the pen)

### Known issues:
1. If the pen gate is open, script will potentially click cow outside, moving your character outside. If the pen door closes while you're outside, character will get stuck.
